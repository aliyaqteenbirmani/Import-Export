#  Cryptocurrency Data Analysis and Visualization 
 This repository showcases a Jupyter Notebook file containing code for analyzing and visualizing cryptocurrency data using Python. The notebook demonstrates step-by-step procedures to retrieve historical data for Bitcoin and Ethereum from a cryptocurrency API, visualize the closing prices over the past week, and export the data to an Excel file.  Table of Contents: 1. Introduction and Setup 2. Importing Libraries 3. Data Retrieval and Conversion 4. Visualizing Closing Prices 5. Generating Dynamic Plots with Bokeh 6. Exporting Data to Excel  Step-by-Step Overview: 1. Start by creating a Jupyter Notebook file in Visual Studio Code. 2. Import the necessary libraries required for data retrieval, visualization, and exporting. 3. Generate random numbers to create sample plots for initial visualization purposes. 4. Utilize the Requests library to fetch historical cryptocurrency data from a dedicated API. Retrieve the closing prices for Bitcoin and Ethereum over the past week and convert the response into a JSON file. 5. Plot the closing prices for both Bitcoin and Ethereum using suitable graphing libraries, such as Matplotlib or Seaborn. 6. Implement the Bokeh library to create dynamic, interactive plots that enhance data exploration and analysis. 7. Lastly, export the retrieved cryptocurrency data to an Excel file, with two separate sheets: one for Bitcoin and another for Ethereum. This facilitates further analysis or sharing of the data with others.  Feel free to explore the notebook, modify the code to suit your specific requirements, and leverage the provided examples for your own projects. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome, as this repository aims to foster learning and collaboration among enthusiasts in the field of cryptocurrency analysis. .
